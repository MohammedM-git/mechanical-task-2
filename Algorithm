1-Start System

Power up the robot and calibrate its joints and sensors.

Confirm the positions of:
a) The table (where items arrive)
b) The lamp/robotic arm base
c) The shelving unit (storage)

2-Scan the Table

Use a camera or sensor to detect if there is a food product on the table.

Wait if the table is empty.

3-Identify the Product

Use object recognition or barcode/label scanner to determine the product type.

Categorize the product (e.g., perishable, non-perishable, or by batch number).

4-Pick Up the Product

Move the robotic arm to the product's location on the table.

Align and lower the gripper.

Grip the product securely.

Lift the product off the table.

5-Determine Shelf Position

Based on the product category, decide which shelf level to use:

Bottom shelf → heavy items or bulk

Middle shelves → general food products

Top shelf → light or priority items

6-Move to Shelf

Rotate and extend the robotic arm toward the target shelf.

Align vertically with the shelf level.

7-Place Product on Shelf

Lower the product to the correct position on the shelf.

Release the grip.

Retract and return the arm to its idle position.

8-Update Inventory

Log the product type, shelf location, and time of placement in a digital system.

9-Loop

Return to Step 2 and repeat the cycle continuously.

10-Shutdown or Maintenance

After a set time or command, enter maintenance mode.

Power down or begin cleaning protocols.
